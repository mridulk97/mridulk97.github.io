abstract = {Discovering evolutionary traits that are heritable across species on the tree of life (also referred to as a phylogenetic tree) is of great interest to biologists to understand how organisms diversify and evolve. However, the measurement of traits is often a subjective and labor-intensive process, making trait discovery a highly label-scarce problem. We present a novel approach for discovering evolutionary traits directly from images without relying on trait labels. Our proposed approach, Phylo-NN, encodes the image of an organism into a sequence of quantized feature vectors -or codes- where different segments of the sequence capture evolutionary signals at varying ancestry levels in the phylogeny. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in producing biologically meaningful results in a number of downstream tasks including species image generation and species-to-species image translation, using fish species as a target example},

abstract = {A central problem in evolutionary biology is to explore the genetic basis of evolutionary changes in the traits of organisms, such as fin structures in fish or beak colors in birds. With the growing availability of large-scale image repositories in biology and recent advances in generative modeling, there is an opportunity to study changes in evolutionary traits of species automatically from images. We introduce a novel Hierarchical Embedding (HIER-Embed) strategy to encode the evolutionary information of a species as a composition of encodings learned at every internal node in the phylogenetic tree. We use HIER-Embeddings to condition latent diffusion models to generate synthetic images of species. Further, we introduce two novel types of perturbation operations: trait masking and trait swapping, similar in spirit to gene knockout experiments, that enable us to analyze novel changes in evolutionary traits acquired at different levels of phylogeny.},

abstract = {Understanding species evolution across the tree of life, commonly known as a phylogenetic tree is a significant area of interest for biologists. The measurement of species traits often relies on subjective assessments and is labor-intensive, leading to a notable shortage of labeled data essential for identifying traits. In this work, we explore integrating biological knowledge with generative models specifically Latent Diffusion Models. We evaluate four different conditioning techniques: Class Conditional, Scientific Name Encoding, Tree-to-Text (T2T) Encoding, and Hierarchical Level Encoding to integrate the phylogenetic information. We validate the methods with their proficiency in generating biologically meaningful images and the ability to capture phenotypical information, aiding in the discovery of novel biological traits.},
